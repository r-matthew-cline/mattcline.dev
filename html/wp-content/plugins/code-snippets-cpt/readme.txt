A WordPress plugin for elegantly hosting, managing, and displaying code snippets. Own your own data!

== Description ==

A WordPress plugin for elegantly hosting, managing, and displaying code snippets. Own your own data!

Adds a custom post type for managing your code snippets with taxonomies for classifying the snippets. Embed snippets with syntax highlighting to posts or pages via a handy shortcode insert button that allows you to pick from the most recent snippets. Syntax highlighting provided by the [Prettify javascript library](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) and the [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/).

Features:

* Host your own snippet library.
* Button for easy-copying of snippet (disable with: `add_filter( 'dsgnwrks_snippet_do_click_to_copy', '__return_false' )`).
* Button to enable full-screen snippet view (disable with: `add_filter( 'dsgnwrks_snippet_enable_full_screen_view', '__return_false' )`).
* Two frontend render engines, prettify (with 2 themes) or Ace (with 32 themes).
* WordPress editor shortcode button for embedding snippets in your content, and creating/editing those snippets on the fly.
* Live (tinymce) previews of the snippets in your content editor.
* Programming language picker (for syntax).
* Snippet tags and categories.
